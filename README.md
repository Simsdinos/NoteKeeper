# NoteKeeper
A simple android application for making and keeping notes
This app has been implemented using android studio ,java language and sqlite database
it uses a recyclerview to enable scrolling
and recycling of views
I have implemented the navigationdrawer for the easy navigation through the app
User can create,edit ,update and delete notes.
There is a floating action button which when clicked it starts a new activity and the user is prompoted to create a new note
